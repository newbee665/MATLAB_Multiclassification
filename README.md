# MATLAB_Multiclassification
This project includes the codes to solve the multi-classification problem with a hybrid decomposition strategy and ensemble feature selection methods.

First, an adaptive resampling technique is introduced into the hybrid decomposition strategy for the purpose of multi-classification. Then, the results of multiple Filter feature selection methods (IG, Chi-square, relief) are integrated as output to improve the performance of feature information.

For your convenience, a small sample dataset xaa.xls is provided.
